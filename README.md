# Low Level Chess
This was made for a codejam hosted by the "A Cup Of Java" discord server. Zohair and I made it in C as a test to learn better fundemental coding skills that are forgetten when working with more modern languages and frameworks. 

## How To Play
To play, you will enter the starting location and the end location of your turn. It does not include what piece you are moving, as that is inferred by what grid coordinate you choose. Example would be "f7f5". This moves the pawn at f7 to f5, a common starting move. You capture pieces the same way.
